## Features

- **Rule-Based Packet Filtering**: Create custom rules based on IP addresses, ports, protocols, and traffic direction
- **Intuitive GUI**: Easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live activity log showing allowed and blocked traffic
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Track total, allowed, and blocked packets
- **Flexible Rule Management**: Add, remove, enable/disable rules on the fly
- **Import/Export Rules**: Save and load rule configurations in JSON format
- **Default Policy Configuration**: Set global ALLOW or BLOCK policy
- **Hit Counter**: Track how many times each rule has been triggered
- **Wildcard Support**: Use wildcards in IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.*)

## Screenshots

### Main Interface
The firewall provides a comprehensive dashboard with rule management, statistics, and activity logging.

### Rule Management
Easily create rules with specific criteria including protocol, source/destination IPs and ports, and traffic direction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Windows OS
- tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Optional (for production deployment)
- `pydivert` or `WinDivert` - For real packet interception
- `scapy` - For advanced packet analysis
- Administrator privileges - Required for packet capture

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-firewall-prototype.git
cd python-firewall-prototype
```

2. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed:
```bash
python --version
```

3. Run the firewall:
```bash
python firewall.py
```

## Usage

### Starting the Firewall

1. Launch the application by running `firewall.py`
2. Click the **"Start Firewall"** button to begin monitoring
3. Monitor traffic in the Activity Log panel
4. View statistics in the Statistics panel

### Managing Rules

#### Adding a Rule
1. Click **"Add Rule"** button
2. Fill in the rule details:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name for the rule
   - **Action**: ALLOW or BLOCK
   - **Protocol**: TCP, UDP, ICMP, or ALL
   - **Source IP**: IP address or "ANY" (supports wildcards like 192.168.1.*)
   - **Source Port**: Port number or "ANY"
   - **Destination IP**: IP address or "ANY"
   - **Destination Port**: Port number or "ANY"
   - **Direction**: INBOUND, OUTBOUND, or BOTH
3. Click **"Save"**

#### Removing a Rule
1. Select a rule from the list
2. Click **"Remove Rule"**
3. Confirm the deletion

#### Enabling/Disabling a Rule
1. Select a rule from the list
2. Click **"Toggle Enable"**
3. The rule will be disabled but not deleted

### Saving and Loading Rules

- **Save Rules**: File → Save Rules (saves to `firewall_rules.json`)
- **Load Rules**: File → Load Rules (loads from `firewall_rules.json`)

### Default Policy

Set the default action for traffic that doesn't match any rule:
- **ALLOW**: Permit all unmatched traffic (default)
- **BLOCK**: Block all unmatched traffic

## Rule Examples

### Block Specific IP
- **Name**: Block Malicious IP
- **Action**: BLOCK
- **Protocol**: ALL
- **Source IP**: 192.168.1.100
- **Destination**: ANY
- **Direction**: BOTH

### Allow Web Traffic
- **Name**: Allow HTTPS
- **Action**: ALLOW
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Destination Port**: 443
- **Direction**: OUTBOUND

### Block Telnet
- **Name**: Block Telnet
- **Action**: BLOCK
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Destination Port**: 23
- **Direction**: BOTH

### Allow Local Network
- **Name**: Allow LAN
- **Action**: ALLOW
- **Protocol**: ALL
- **Source IP**: 192.168.1.*
- **Direction**: BOTH

## Configuration File Format

Rules are saved in JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Allow HTTPS",
    "action": "ALLOW",
    "protocol": "TCP",
    "src_ip": "ANY",
    "src_port": "ANY",
    "dst_ip": "ANY",
    "dst_port": "443",
    "direction": "OUTBOUND",
    "enabled": true
  }
]
```

## Architecture

The firewall consists of three main components:

1. **FirewallRule**: Represents individual filtering rules with matching logic
2. **FirewallEngine**: Core engine that evaluates packets against rules
3. **FirewallGUI**: User interface for managing rules and monitoring traffic

### Current Implementation

This prototype uses **simulated traffic** for demonstration purposes. The simulation generates random packets to showcase the firewall's filtering capabilities.

### Production Deployment

For real packet interception on Windows, you would need to:

1. **Install WinDivert or PyDivert**:
```bash
pip install pydivert
```

2. **Implement packet capture**: Replace the simulation with actual packet interception
3. **Run with Administrator privileges**: Required for low-level network access
4. **Add packet parsing**: Use libraries like `scapy` for detailed packet analysis

Example integration with PyDivert:
```python
import pydivert

with pydivert.WinDivert("true") as w:
    for packet in w:
        packet_info = parse_packet(packet)
        action = engine.evaluate_packet(packet_info)
        if action == "ALLOW":
            w.send(packet)
        # BLOCK: don't send, packet is dropped
```

## Limitations

- **Prototype Status**: This is an educational prototype, not production-ready
- **Simulated Traffic**: Uses simulated packets instead of real network traffic
- **No Deep Packet Inspection**: Does not analyze packet contents
- **Basic Pattern Matching**: Limited to IP/port matching
- **Windows Only**: Designed specifically for Windows platform

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: This is a learning tool and should not be used as a primary security solution. For production environments, use:

- Windows Defender Firewall
- Enterprise firewall solutions
- Professional network security appliances
